### About me:
âœ¨ I'm an **Data Analyst** with a background in Environmental **Engineering**, passionate about using data, technology, and programming to solve real-world problems

### Skills & Experience:

I developed my programming skills in university by creating a VBA tool for water leakage calculations and conducting a cost-effectiveness analysis for my thesis. After relocating to Denmark, I enhanced my data expertise through a program at ReDI School, focusing on Python, SQL, and business analysis. I also gained experience in leadership, co-creation, and design thinking through workshops.

ðŸ“’ Currently, Iâ€™m deepening my expertise in **business metrics, statistics, machine learning, and tools like Tableau and Power BI**, through the TripleTen Bootcamp and additional online courses.

 

### **Highlights & Awards**: 
- Circular Design Camp Winner (2024): My team won Best Solution for a real business challenge involving community engagement in a COâ‚‚-reduction project. We designed a communication strategy to build public support, applying creative thinking and teamwork in a hands-on, real-world setting.

- Academic Achievement: Graduated with the second-highest GPA in my class, demonstrating dedication and continuous motivation to grow throughout my academic and professional journey.
