## Welcome! âœ¨

### About me:
âœ¨ I'm an **Data Analyst** with a background in Environmental **Engineering** from UFPB (Brazil) passionate about using data, technology, and programming to solve real-world problems

### Academic & Projects:
My interest in programming began during university, where I created a VBA tool to calculate water leakage in buildings, and later conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis for my thesis. These experiences strengthened my skills in data interpretation, problem-solving, and communication.

After moving to Denmark, I enhanced my data skills through a program at ReDI School, focusing on Python, SQL, and stakeholder-oriented analysis. I also participated in workshops on leadership, co-creation, and design thinking, which developed my ability to collaborate and innovate.


ðŸ“’ Currently, Iâ€™m deepening my expertise in **business metrics, statistics, machine learning, and tools like Tableau and Power BI**, through the TripleTen Bootcamp and additional online courses.

 

### **Highlights & Awards**: 
- Circular Design Camp Winner
  
In September 2024, I joined the Circular Design Camp â€” a two-day innovation event focused on the circular economy. My team won Best Solution for a real business challenge involving community engagement in a COâ‚‚-reduction project. We designed an effective communication strategy to build public support. The experience was highly collaborative and hands-on, allowing us to apply creative thinking, rapid prototyping, and teamwork in a real-world context.

- Academic Achievement:
  
Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have stayed dedicated and motivated to continuously grow. This commitment is reflected in graduating with the second-highest GPA in my class.

 

### Contact:
Iâ€™m excited to contribute to meaningful projects and help organizations and stakeholders tackle challenges with data-driven solutions.
