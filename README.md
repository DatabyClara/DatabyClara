## Welcome! ‚ú®

### üîç About me:
‚ú® I'm an Environmental **Engineering** graduate from UFPB (Brazil) with a **deep passion for data, technology, and problem-solving through programming**. 

During university, I discovered a **strong interest in programming and its ability to improve problem-solving**. One of the highlights of my academic journey was a course on **Programming Applied to Environmental Engineering**, where I developed a VBA-based application to calculate water leakage in buildings ‚Äî that was when I discovered how coding could significantly increase efficiency and accuracy in solving real-world challenges. I also work on a cost-effectiveness analysis for my final thesis, identifying optimal scenarios based on both cost and effectiveness ‚Äî an experience that refined my **analytical thinking**, communication, and writing skills.

After moving to Denmark,  had the opportunity to deepen my knowledge by attending a Data Analyst program in ReDI School focused on **data analysis, Python, SQL, trend observation, and stakeholder engagement**. I also joined several workshops focused on **leadership, problem-solving, co-creation, and design thinking**, which helped shape my collaborative and interdisciplinary approach to tackling challenge. 

üìí Currently, I‚Äôm deepening my expertise in **business metrics, statistics, machine learning, and tools like Tableau and Power BI**, through the TripleTen Bootcamp and additional online courses.

 

### üèÖ **Highlights**: 
- Circular Design Camp Winner
  
In September 2024, I participated in the Circular Design Camp ‚Äî a two-day innovation event focused on the circular economy. **My team was awarded Best Solution for a Real Business Challenge**. The challenge we tackled a challenge involving community engagement for a CO2-reduction project, where we had to design an **effective communication** strategy to gain public support. The event was immersive and collaborative, giving us a chance to apply creative thinking, rapid prototyping, and **teamwork in a real business context**.

- Academic Achievement:
  
ü•á Throughout my academic and professional path, I‚Äôve remained dedicated and **constantly driven to grow**. A reflection of this commitment is graduating with the second-highest GPA in my class.
